=Guild Wars Multi-Launch=

Open Source License: GPLv3

==Summary==

Launching multiple copies of Guild Wars.
(no modifications to Guild Wars files!)

==Requirements==

  # Guild Wars
  # .NET Framework 2.0 or equivalent
  # Windows XP, Vista, or 7

==Usage==

Copies of the Guild Wars folder need to be made. The number of copies depends on how many copies you would like to have open at once. You will only need to make 1 extra copy to be able to run two copies side by side.

After these copies are made, add them to the list. Then, make the multi-launch enabled shortcuts which are good for launching multiple copies of Guild Wars. Or just select the game and launch it from the gui.

Concisely:

  # Make copies of Guild Wars folder (just need gw.exe and gw.dat)
  # Add the gw.exe(s) to the list
  # Double click item to launch
    * or click "Launch" button
    * or make a shortcut for external launching

Guild Wars Updates: When there is an update, you will need to launch a second time if you have multiple Guild Wars updating at the same time. See gw.dat question in the FAQ for details.

Texmod Usage: Check the FAQ section.

==Basic Controls==

  * Add - add the location of an existing copy
  * Remove - remove selected copy from list
  * Make Copy - make a copy (make sure to create new folder in dialog)
  * Launch - start the selected copies
  * Make Desktop Shortcut - add a desktop shortcut to launch selected copy

==Expert Controls==

  * Set Registry Path - path should be set before manually starting a specific install
  * Clear Mutex - closes the mutex handle under all live gw.exe processes
  * Open Texmod - attempts to locate Texmod and open
  * Force gw.dat unlock - read warning message... useful if you are out of diskspace and need to desperately mule without extra copies

===Launch Sequence===

  # Set new gw path in registry
  # Mutex cleared from all gw.exe processes
  # Launch gw copy

==FAQ==

Q: Do I have to always use the launcher or the special shortcuts?

A: No, you only need to use the launcher or shortcuts when you wish to launch multiple copies of Guild Wars.

Q: Why do I get a "gw.dat is locked" message?

A: This is often the case if you launch the copy without setting the registry path properly. If you are planning to launch multiplecopies, the registry path must be set properly to avoid conflicts. Gw.exe will always use the path found in the registry to locate gw.dat.

Q: When I try to launch muliple copies at once through the launcher, not all of them launch. Why?

A: The default delay between copies is current set to 3000 milliseconds in the "regdelay" setting in your ini file. Increase this value for slower computers since Guild Wars may need more time to read the value off the registry before it is set to something else for the next copy.

Q: What is a Mutex?

A: Simple answer, a flag that gw.exe puts up so new gw.exe processes know to not launch. Long answer, check wikipedia.

Q: How do I use Texmod with this?

A: To launch a Texmoded copy:
   # Select the copy you will be launching and click "Set Registry Path"
   # Click "Clear Mutex"
   # Open Texmod and launch the copy

Q: How do I report a bug?
